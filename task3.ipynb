    "\n",
    "High Energy Physics (HEP) faces computational challenges that align with potential quantum computing advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "LHC experiments generate petabytes of complex collision data, while Monte Carlo simulations consume vast computing resources\n",
    "Particle tracking and jet reconstruction involve NP-hard graph problems,and at the same time, QCD and other quantum field theories are fundamentally quantum mechanical. So quantum algorithms have the potential advantage in solving HEP problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "While quantum hardware remains in the NISQ era (50-433 qubits with significant noise), several HEP-specific applications show promise for near and medium-term quantum advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Areas that quantum algorithms illustrate potential advantage include Jet Physics, Event Selection and Simulations of Quantum Systems.\n",

    "## Potential Chanllenges\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum computing hardware remains in the NISQ area. Most HEP problems require more qubits and lower error rates than currently available.Efficiently mapping high-dimensional HEP data to quantum states remains challenging. \n",
    "So most promising near-term applications combine classical and quantum components.\n",

    "As a sophomore student working in computational physics,my interest lies in utilizing the current deep-learning algorithms and using hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for simulations through interdisciplinary collaboration between physicists, computer scientists, and quantum computing experts. This research would create practical simulation tools that leverage current classical ML strengths while strategically incorporating quantum components where they show promise. By focusing on incremental integration of quantum-inspired techniques into existing workflows, we can deliver immediate performance improvements while establishing foundations for future quantum advantage. This balanced approach addresses present computational bottlenecks in detector simulation and event generation while positioning our research at the forefront of quantum applications in physics."
